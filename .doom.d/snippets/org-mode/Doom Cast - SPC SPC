SPC - Find file in project
*** Signature
[[help:+ivy/projectile-find-file][(+ivy/projectile-find-file)]]

*** Documentation
A more sensible [[help:counsel-projectile-find-file][(counsel-projectile-find-file)]], which will revert to
[[help:counsel-find-file][(counsel-find-file)]] if invoked from $HOME, [[help:counsel-file-jump][(counsel-file-jump)]] if invoked from a
non-project, [[help:projectile-find-file][(projectile-find-file)]] if in a big project (more than
[[help:ivy-sort-max-size][ivy-sort-max-size]] files), or [[help:counsel-projectile-find-file][(counsel-projectile-find-file)]] therwise.

The point of this is to avoid Emacs locking up indexing massive file trees.
